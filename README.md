What is Druid?
-------------
From their website at http://druid.io

*Druid is an open-source analytics data store designed for
business intelligence (OLAP) queries on event data. Druid provides low
latency (real-time) data ingestion, flexible data exploration,
and fast data aggregation. Existing Druid deployments have scaled to
trillions of events and petabytes of data. Druid is best used to
power analytic dashboards and applications.*

Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

[See in the documentation](http://airbnb.io/caravel/installation.html)

=======
=======
<<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>> merge from caravel/master
Installation
------------

Dashed is currently only tested using Python 2.7.*. Python 3 support is
on the roadmap, Python 2.6 won't be supported.

Follow these few simple steps to install Dashed.

```
# Install dashed
pip install dashed

# Create an admin user
fabmanager create-admin --app dashed

# Initialize the database
dashed db upgrade

# Create default roles and permissions
dashed init

# Load some data to play with
dashed load_examples

# Start the development web server
dashed runserver -d
```

After installation, you should be able to point your browser to the right
hostname:port [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088), login using
the credential you entered while creating the admin account, and navigate to
`Menu -> Admin -> Refresh Metadata`. This action should bring in all of 
your datasources for Dashed to be aware of, and they should show up in
`Menu -> Datasources`, from where you can start playing with your data!

Configuration
-------------

To configure your application, you need to create a file (module) 
`dashed_config.py` and make sure it is in your PYTHONPATH. Here are some
of the parameters you can copy / paste in that configuration module:

```
#---------------------------------------------------------
# Dashed specifix config
#---------------------------------------------------------
ROW_LIMIT = 5000
WEBSERVER_THREADS = 8

DASHED_WEBSERVER_PORT = 8088
#---------------------------------------------------------

#---------------------------------------------------------
# Flask App Builder configuration
#---------------------------------------------------------
# Your App secret key
SECRET_KEY = '\2\1thisismyscretkey\1\2\e\y\y\h'

# The SQLAlchemy connection string.
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:////tmp/dashed.db'

# Flask-WTF flag for CSRF
CSRF_ENABLED = True

# Whether to run the web server in debug mode or not
DEBUG = True
```

This file also allows you to define configuration parameters used by
Flask App Builder, the web framework used by Dashed. Please consult
the [Flask App Builder Documentation](http://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html) for more information on how to configure Dashed.


* From the UI, enter the information about your clusters in the 
``Admin->Clusters`` menu by hitting the + sign. 

* Once the Druid cluster connection information is entered, hit the 
``Admin->Refresh Metadata`` menu item to populate

* Navigate to your datasources
